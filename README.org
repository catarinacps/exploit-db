** Introduction

This is the repository dedicated to the final assignment of Database
Fundamentals. The assignment is divided in two parts:

- Part 1 :: Conceptual and logical modeling of the database
- Part 2 :: Implementation of the database and implementation of an application
            that uses said database through some queries.

** Project structure

The project follows this structure:

- =assets/= :: Here lies the sample files utilized by the SQL scripts
- =conceptual/= :: The home of the project-phase model files
- =doc/= :: Documentation of the project regarding its development
- =src/= :: Home of the implemented application source code
- =sql/= :: Where the SQL scripts should stay
